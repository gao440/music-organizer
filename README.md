Vibify
A places and events around us all have many stimulations that effect how we experience them like touch, sight, and sound. Pictures are able to capture just one dimension of the experience. Sometimes to understand more about what is happening in a photo you need audio aids. This is where vibify comes in, vibify will create a playlist around an inputed image that will be personalized to the user and the photo provided.

## What it does
This service allows you to gain insight into an event or photo in a lower friction way by using something that everyone enjoys, music. We seek to make it so that people can understand a little bit more about the situations about the world through an enjoyable way. 

## How I built it
This is built using Google Cloud Vision API and Spotify's playlist creation API using keywords generated by the Google Cloud Vision AI. This program uses google cloud vision to gather information from the photos such as the object, facial emotions, and text can be read into the program and be considered in the process of creating a playlist for the end user.
